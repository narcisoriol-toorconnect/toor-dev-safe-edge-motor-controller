acceptance_criteria: "- Partition map documented; Safety Core binaries and interfaces identified.\n- Minor update path modifies only Application partition; attempts to modify Safety Core are rejected with logs.\n- Safety Core integrity CRC verified at boot and periodically; failure triggers EMERGENCY safe state.\n- Post‑update self‑tests run before enabling motion; failure prevents enable and logs reason.\n- Runtime attestation check prevents Application from bypassing Safety Core interlocks."
brief: Protect safety-critical behavior from unintended changes across updates.

details: "Partition the firmware so safety‑critical behavior remains protected across routine updates. Define two partitions: Safety Core (self‑tests, monitoring, safe‑state logic, command interlocks) and Application (HMI, non‑critical features). Policy: Safety Core is immutable for minor updates; only Application is updated routinely. Integrity: Safety Core CRC verified at boot and periodically; cross‑signature validation prevents Application from altering Safety Core behavior. Post‑update gating: device remains disabled until post‑update self‑tests pass."
milestone: M1
notes:
  []
priority: high
rationale: Isolating the safety core ensures routine updates cannot compromise safety behavior and simplifies assurance and audits.
