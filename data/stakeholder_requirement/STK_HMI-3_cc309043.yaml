acceptance_criteria: "- Parity matrix executed across HW and simulation: views reachable with identical labels and flows.\n- Command flows (Start/Stop/ACK/Mode/Speed) behave identically including interlocks and error messaging.\n- Fault indications and recovery messaging match content and sequence.\n- Timing variance between HW and sim ≤ 10% for display updates and command response.\n- Parity score ≥ 95% pass rate across scenarios; any deviations documented with rationale."
brief: Ensure consistent HMI behavior between hardware and simulation.

details: "Ensure functional parity between hardware HMI and browser‑based simulation for operator‑facing behaviors. Parity scope: views, states, commands, messages, and fault/ACK flows. Tolerance: timing differences ≤ 10% are acceptable; visual layout may differ but naming and hierarchy must match. Provide a parity test matrix covering all operator flows and fault classes."
