acceptance_criteria: "- UI exposes toggles for each fault; scenario runner loads YAML and plays sequences.\n- Each injected fault produces the same class/action as hardware targets.\n- Metrics recorded with timestamps and exported to CSV/JSON.\n- At least 10 reference scenarios provided (startup, normal run, each fault class, update/rollback demonstration)."
brief: Support fault injection and scenario demonstration in simulation.
dependencies:
  []
details: "Offer fault injection and scripted scenarios in the simulation to validate safety behavior. Fault catalog: overcurrent, undervoltage, overtemp, encoder loss, comms loss, watchdog expiry. Injection methods: UI toggles and YAML scenario scripts (timelines and triggers). Metrics captured: timestamps, state transitions, fault codes, and HMI messages; exported as CSV/JSON."
