acceptance_criteria: "- Start/Stop, Mode select, Speed setpoint implemented and exercised in demo scripts.\n- HMI shows state, RPM, bus voltage, current, temperature, and version.\n- Faults during operation trigger defined safe‑state behaviors.\n- Simulation demonstrates identical flows for the above.\n"
brief: "Functional summary: single motor control with supervision and HMI."

details: "The device controls a single electric motor with integrated safety supervision. Core functions: Start/Stop, Mode select (Stop/Run), speed setpoint (0–100%), speed regulation, health monitoring, safe‑state transition on faults, and an HMI that displays states, faults, and version. Provides a simulation presenting the same behaviors for demos. Behaves deterministically under all operating conditions."
milestone: M1
notes:
  []
priority: high
rationale: Make the product purpose and top‑level capabilities explicit for client sign‑off and downstream design.
