acceptance_criteria: "- State diagram produced and versioned; transitions and guards defined.\n- Implementation exposes current state in HMI and logs changes with RT_SAFE codes.\n- Transition timing budgets met per STK_SAFETY‑2/3 (e.g., EMERGENCY disable ≤ 1 ms).\n- Demo scenarios exercise each transition at least once."

details: "Define device modes and states: BOOT (self‑tests), IDLE (enabled, stopped), RUN (closed‑loop control), WARN (non‑latching advisory), FAULT (latched until ACK+clear), EMERGENCY (latched until power‑cycle), SAFE (outputs disabled), UPDATE (A/B update), DIAGNOSTICS (read‑only). Specify transitions and guards (e.g., BOOT→IDLE on pass, RUN→FAULT on monitored condition, FAULT→IDLE on ACK+clear). Include timing budgets for transitions consistent with safety requirements."
milestone: M1
notes:
  []
priority: high
rationale: Make behavior predictable and testable; forms the backbone of control logic and HMI.
