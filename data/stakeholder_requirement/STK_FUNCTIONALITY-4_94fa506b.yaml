acceptance_criteria: "- Step tests meet ±5% accuracy within 1 s for 20% steps.\n- Rate limit enforced ≤ 20%/s; verified with scripted ramp.\n- Start latency ≤ 150 ms; Stop to zero‑torque ≤ 50 ms in FAULT‑free conditions.\n- Limits and interlocks prevent exceeding safety thresholds; logs show guard enforcement."
brief: Control performance (demo defaults).

details: "Provide basic speed control performance suitable for demos. Defaults (tunable): setpoint range 0–100%; steady‑state speed accuracy ±5% within 1 s after a step ≤ 20%; rate limit ≤ 20%/s; Start command to motion output latency ≤ 150 ms in RUN; Stop to zero‑torque ≤ 50 ms (non‑EMERGENCY). Respect interlocks and monitoring limits at all times; never exceed EMERGENCY thresholds."
milestone: M1
notes:
  []
priority: medium
rationale: Sets realistic, testable demo performance targets without over‑constraining future design.
